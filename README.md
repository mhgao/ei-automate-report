# ei-automate-report

A script for generating simple reports on EI & ER analysis, from simple user inputs. Utilizes the eiPack package in R.

Can be used to show voting patterns within a certain demographic (or coalition of multiple demographics).

Sourcing EI_automate.R runs a loop over the EI_parameterized.Rmd and generates multiples reports (one for each election input).


## Instructions

Open EI_automate.R in R studio. Fill out the user inputs at the top of the file. Source the file, resulting in reports in the same directory.
